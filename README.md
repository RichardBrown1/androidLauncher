# Android Text Launcher 
can add to favs list, swipe right for all apps list. pretty basic. 

## Info
Hopefully works on all phones, specifically made to take advantage of the bezel-less displays
Does not refresh the favs list when adding new apps / removing (which is done by holding down the app name and pressing pin/unpin in the all apps list)
There is a get colour from applications icon code for the favs list which I have disabled since it turns out it looks ugly
 
##Todo
clean up code
add changing order of favs list or sort by alphabet + settings at the bottom maybe?
automatically refresh favs list when unpinning / pinning apps to list
add notifications
add context menu to all apps screen
add widgets support? 
add some spacing after the list
create a preferences page

kotlin coversion maybe?
