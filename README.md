# Android Text Launcher

can add to favourites list, swipe right for all apps list. while looking pretty :)

## Info

- Hopefully works on all phones, specifically made to take advantage of displays - with very small bezels (like my xiaomi 9t). Thought I'd hide the status bar since I don't need them on the homescreen as its used to get from 1 app to another.
- Does not refresh the favourites list when adding new apps / removing (which is done by holding down the app name and pressing pin/unpin in the all apps list)
- There is a get colour from applications icon code for the favs list which I have disabled since it turns out it looks ugly - (would like to redo and add this for notifications)

## Screenshots

Wallpaper not made by me, it shows the text shadows well though. (Calming coastline, Lagos - Google Earth Living Wallpapers)
