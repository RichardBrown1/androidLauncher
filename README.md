can add to favs list, swipe right for all apps list. pretty basic. 


## Info
Does not refresh the favs list when adding new apps / removing (which is done by long pressing in the all apps list)
There is a get colour from applications icon code for the favs list which I have disabled since it turns out it looks ugly
 
##Todo
